## WHAT IS IT?

CCOPENLIB is a free open source library for C++14 that provides commonly needed patterns.

## GOAL

It will have no external dependencies other than C++14.

It will provide classes that I commonly need and you might find in other libraries that are either subject to change, too complex or too large.

## WHY

I provide this to the world under an MIT license as an appreciation to other libraries that are provided under permissive licenses that I might have used in the past.

## EXAMPLES

Examples are found in the documentation or in EXAMPLES.md files in the include folder structure.

Even major versions will guarantee ABI compatibility. So 2.2.0.0 will be ABI compatible with 2.1.0.0.
